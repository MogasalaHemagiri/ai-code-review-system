üìñ How It Works

The AI Code Review System uses advanced machine learning models to:
1. Scan Your Code: Analyzes syntax, structure, and logic.
2. Identify Issues: Flags potential errors or inefficiencies.
3. Generate Feedback: Offers detailed suggestions with examples.

Think of it as your personal AI pair-programmer!

üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Run a review on your codebase:
```bash
python main.py --path ./my-project --output report.json
```

Example output:
```json
{
  "file": "example.py",
  "line": 42,
  "suggestion": "Consider using a list comprehension for better readability."
}
```
